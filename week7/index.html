    <h1>Week 7 Notes</h1>
    <li>
      We covered functions back in chapter 4, but we were only just beginning to
      scratch the surface. In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, which means
      they can be passed around in the same way as every other value. They can have
      their own properties and methods, as well as accepting other functions as
      parameters and being returned by other functions. This makes them a very
      flexible tool to work with in JavaScript, and there are a variety of techniques and
      patterns that can be used to make code cleaner.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Function Properties and Methods</h2>
      <p>
        <pre>
          The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an
          object that is provided as the first argument.
          In the following example, the sayHello() function refers to an unspecific object
          called this that has a property called name:
          function sayHello(){
          return `Hello, my name is ${ this.name }`;
          }
          We can create some objects that have a name property, then use the call()
          method to invoke the sayHello() function, providing each object as an
          argument. This will then take the value of this in the function:
          const clark = { name: 'Clark' };
          const bruce = { name: 'Bruce' };
          sayHello.call(clark);
          << 'Hello, my name is Clarke'
          sayHello.call(bruce);
        </pre>
        <pre>
          The apply() method works in the same way, except the arguments of the
function are provided as an array, even if there is only one argument:
square.apply(null, [4])
        </pre>
        <h4>
          These are two powerful methods, as they allow generalized functions to be
written that are not tied to specific objects by being methods of that object. This
gives flexibility over how the functions can be used.
        </h4>
      </p>
      <h3>Custom Properties</h3>
      <pre>
        There is nothing to stop you adding your own properties to functions in the same
way that you can add properties to any object in JavaScript. For example, you
could add a description property to a function that describes what it does:
square.description = 'Squares a number that is provided as an argument'
<< 'Squares a number that is provided as an argument'
      </pre>
      <h3>Memoization</h3>
      <p>
        If a function takes some time to compute a return value, we can save the result in
a cache property. Then if the same argument is used again later, we can return
the value from the cache, rather than having to compute the result again.
      </p>
    </li>
    <h2>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</h2>
     <pre>
      An Immediately Invoked Function Expression – or IIFE – (pronounced 'iffy')
      is an anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it’s
      defined. This is easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function
      definition (remember we use parentheses to invoke a function). The function
      also has to be made into an expression, which is done by placing the whole
      declaration inside parentheses, as in this example:
      (function(){
      const temp = 'World';
      console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);
      })();
      << 'Hello World'
     </pre>
     <h2>Temporary Variables</h2>
     <pre>
      let a = 1;
      let b = 2;
      (()=>{
      const temp = a;
      a = b;
      b = temp;
      })();
      a;
      << 2
      b;
      << 1
      console.log(temp);
      << Error: "temp is not defined
     </pre>
     <p>Swapping variables in ES</p>^
     <code>
      let [a,b] = [1,2];
      [a,b] = [b,a];
      a;
      << 2
      b;
      << 1
     </code>
     <h3>Initialization code</h3>
     <pre>
        {
        console.log('hey')
        } 
     </pre>
     <li>
       <h3>Safe Use of Strict Mode</h3>
       <pre>
          (function() {
          'use strict';
          // All your code would go inside this function
          })();          
       </pre>
     </li>
     <li>
       <h1>Functions that define and rewrite themselves</h1>
        <pre>
            function party(){
            console.log('Wow this is amazing!');
            party = function(){
            console.log('Been there, got the T-Shirt');
            }
            }
        </pre>
        <code>
          party();
          << 'Wow this is amazing!'
          party();
          << 'Been there, got the T-Shirt'
          party();
          << 'Been there, got the T-Shirt'
        </code>
     </li>
     <li>
       <h3>Init-Time Branching</h3>
       <p>
        This technique can be used with the feature detection that we discussed in the
        last chapter to create functions that rewrite themselves, known as init-time
        branching. This enables the functions to work more effectively in the browser,
        and avoid checking for features every time they’re invoked.
       </p>
       <h4>This can be a useful pattern to initialize functions the first time they’re called,
        optimizing them for the browser being used.
        </h4>
     </li>
     <li>
       <h3>Recursive functions</h3>
       <pre>
        A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met. It’s
        a useful tool to use when iterative processes are involved. A common example is
        a function that calculates the factorial of a number:
        function factorial(n) {
        if (n === 0) {
        return 1;
        } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
        }
       </pre>
     </li>
     <li>
       <h3>Callback Hell</h3>
       <a href="http://callbackhell.com/">callbackhell</a>
       <pre>
         <p>
          This is the most important part:
           Anyone is capable of creating modules (aka libraries). To quote Isaac
            Schlueter (of the node.js project): "Write small modules that each do one thing, 
            and assemble them into other modules that do a bigger thing. 
            You can't get into callback hell if you don't go there."
         </p>
       </pre>
     </li>
     <li>
       <h2>Promises</h2>
       <p>
        A promise represents the future result of an asynchronous operation. Promises
        don't do anything that can't already be achieved using callbacks, but they help
        simplify the process, and avoid the convoluted code that can result from using
        multiple callbacks.
       </p>
       <p>
        When a promise is created, it calls an asynchronous operation and is then said to
        be pending. It remains in this state while the operation is taking place. At this
        stage, the promise is said to be unsettled. Once the operation has completed, the
        promise is said to have been settled. A settled promise can result in two different
        outcomes:
        Resolved ― the asynchronous operation was completed successfully.
        Rejected ― the asynchronous operation didn`t work as expected, wasn't
        successfully completed or resulted in an error.
       </p>
       <pre>
          const promise = new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {
          // initialization code goes here
          if (success) {
          resolve(value);
          } else {
          reject(error);
          }
          });
       </pre>
       <h3>Dealing with a settled promise</h3>
       <code>
        login(userName)
        .then(user => getPlayerInfo(user.id))
        .then(info => loadGame(info))
        .catch( throw error)
       </code>
     </li>
     <li>
       <h3>Async Functions</h3>
       <code>
        async function loadGame(userName) {
          try {
          const user = await login(userName);
          const info = await getPlayerInfo (user.id);
          // load the game using the returned info
          }
          catch (error){
          throw error;
          }
          }
       </code>
     </li>
     <li>
       <h3>
        Generalized Functions
       </h3>
       <p>Swap two values using destructuring: [a,b] = [b,a];</p>
       <code>
          function random(a,b,callback) {
          if (b === undefined) b = a, a = 1; // if only one argument is supplied, assume the lower limit is 1
          const result = Math.floor((b-a+1) * Math.random()) + a
          if(callback) {
          result = callback(result);
          }
          return result;
          }
       </code>
     </li>
     <li>
       <h3>
         Functions that return functions
       </h3>
       <pre>
          function returnHello() {
          console.log('returnHello() called');
          return function() {
          console.log('Hello World!');
          }
          }          
       </pre>
       <pre>
        When the returnHello() function is invoked, it logs a message to the console
        then returns another function:
        returnHello()
        << returnHello() called
        To make use of the function that is returned, we need to assign it to a variable:
        const hello = returnHello();
        << returnHello() called
        Now we can invoke the 'Hello World' function by placing parentheses after the
        variable that it was assigned to:
        hello()
        << Hello World!        
       </pre>
     </li>
     <li>
       <h3>Closures</h3>
       <pre>
        A closure is a reference to a variable that was created inside the scope of another
        function, but is then kept alive and used in another part of the program.
        One of the key principles in creating closures is that an 'inner' function, which is
        declared inside another function, has full access to all of the variables declared
        inside the scope of the function in which it’s declared (the 'outer' function). This
        can be seen in the example below:
        function outer() {
        const outside = 'Outside!';
        function inner() {
        const inside = 'Inside!';
        console.log(outside);
        console.log(inside);
        }
        console.log(outside);
        inner();
        }        
       </pre>
       <pre>
        As we saw in the example above, functions declared from within another
        function have access to any variables declared in the outer function’s scope.
        <b>A closure is formed when the inner function is returned by the outer function,
        maintaining access to any variables declared inside the enclosing function.</b>
        function outer() {
        const outside = 'Outside!';
        function inner() {
        const inside = 'Inside!';
        console.log(outside);
        console.log(inside);
        }
        return inner;
        }
       </pre>
       <pre>
        We can now assign a variable to the return value of the outer() function:
        const closure = outer();
       </pre>
       <h4>A closure is formed when a function returns another function that then maintains
        access to any variables created in the original function’s scope.</h4>
     </li>
     <li>
       <h2>Generators</h2>
       <p>
        These are special functions used to
        produce iterators that maintain the state of a value.        
       </p>
       <pre>
        To define a generator function, an asterisk symbol (*) is placed after the function
        declaration, like so:
        function* exampleGenerator() {
        // code for the generator goes here
        }        
       </pre>
       <pre>
        function* fibonacci(a,b) {
          let [ prev,current ] = [ a,b ];
          while(true) {
          [prev, current] = [current, prev + current];
          yield current;
          }
          }          
       </pre>
     </li>
     <li>
       <h2>Functional Programming</h2>
       <pre>
        A key aspect of functional programming is its use of pure functions. A pure
        function is a function that adheres to the following rules:
        1) The return value of a pure function should only depend on the values provided
        as arguments. It doesn't rely on values from somewhere else in the program.
        2) There are no side-effects. A pure function doesn't change any values or data
        elsewhere in the program. It only makes non-destructive data transformations
        and returns new values, rather than altering any of the underlying data.
        3) Referential transparency. Given the same arguments, a pure function will
        always return the same result.
       </pre>
       <pre>
        In order to follow these rules, any pure function must have:
        At least one argument; otherwise the return value must depend on
        something other than the arguments of the function, breaking the first rule
        A return value; otherwise there’s no point in the function (unless it has
        changed something else in the program – in which case, it’s broken the 'no
        side-effects' rule).        
       </pre>
     </li>
     <li>
       <h3>Higher-Order Functions</h3>
       <p>Higher-order functions are functions that accept another function as an
        argument, or return another function as a result, or both.</p>
        <p>
          This
means we can use it to build other, more specific functions by using different
arguments.
        </p>
        <pre>
        const elevado = n => {
          return power => Math.pow(n, power);
        }
        
        const doisElevadoA = elevado(2);
        const tresElevadoA = elevado(3);
        </pre>
        <h4>trick</h4>
        <pre>
          When a higher-order function returns another function, we can use a neat trick to
          create an anonymous return function and immediately invoke it with a value
          instead by using double parentheses. The following example will calculate 3 to
          the power 5:
          power(3)(5);
          << 243
          This works because power(3) returns a function, to which we immediately pass
          an argument of 5 by adding it in parentheses at the end.
        </pre>
     </li>
     <li>
       <h2>Currying</h2>
       <p>
        A function is said to be curried when not all arguments have been supplied to the
        function, so it returns another function that retains the arguments already
        provided, and expects the remaining arguments that were omitted when the
        original function was called. A final result is only returned once all the expected
        arguments have eventually been provided.
       </p>
     </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Ajax</h1>
  Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with
  a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading. This enables
  data to be sent and received in the background, as well as portions of a page to
  be updated in response to user events, while the rest of the program continues to
  run.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h2>Clients and servers</h2>
      <pre>
        The web of computers known as the internet can be separated into two parts:
        clients and servers. A client, such as a web browser, will request a resource
        (usually a web page) from a server, which processes the request and sends back a
        response to the client.
      </pre>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Same-Origin Policy</h3>
          <pre>
            The same-origin policy in browsers blocks all requests from a domain that is
            different from the page making the request. This policy is enforced by all
            modern browsers and is to stop any malicious JavaScript being run from an
            external source. The problem is that the APIs of many websites rely on data
            being transferred across domains.
          </pre>
          <h3>CORS</h3>
          <pre>
            is a solution to this problem as it allows
            resources to be requested from another website outside the original domain. The
            CORS standard works by using HTTP headers to indicate which domains can
            receive data. A website can have the necessary information in its headers to
            allow external sites access to its API data. Most modern browsers support this
            method and respect the restrictions specified in the headers.
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Asynchronous JavaScript and XML</h3>
          <pre>
            Asynchronous
              When a request for data is sent, the program doesn’t have to stop and wait
              for the response. It can carry on running, waiting for an event to fire when a
              response is received. By using callbacks to manage this, programs are able
              to run in an efficient way, avoiding lag as data is transferred back and forth.
            JavaScript
              JavaScript was always considered a 'front-end' language, not used to
              communicate with the server. Ajax enabled JavaScript to send requests and
              receive responses from a server, allowing content to be updated in real time.
            XML
              When the term Ajax was originally coined, XML documents were often
              used to return data. Many different types of data can be sent, but by far the
              most commonly used in Ajax nowadays is JSON, which is more
              lightweight and easier to parse than XML. (Although it has never really
              taken off, the term Ajaj is sometimes used to describe the technique.) JSON
              also has the advantage of being natively supported in JavaScript, so you can
              deal with JavaScript objects rather than having to parse XML files using
              DOM methods.
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>APIS</h3>
          <pre>
            An application programming interface (API) is a collection of methods that
            allows external access to another program or service. Many websites allow
            controlled access to their data via public APIs. This means that developers are
            able to interact with the data and create mashups of third-party services. A
            weather site, for example, might have an API that provides methods that return
            information about the weather in a given location, such as temperature, wind
            speed, and so on. This can then be used to display local weather data on a web
            page. The information that’s returned by APIs is often serialized as JSON. Since
            the data is being provided by an external site, CORS will have to be enabled in
            order to access information from an API. Some services may also require
            authentication in order to access their APIs.
          </pre>
          <h3>Fetch API</h3>
          <code>
            fetch('https://example.com/data')
            .then( // code that handles the response )
            .catch( // code that runs if the server returns an error
          </code>
          <h3>Creating Response Objects</h3>
          <pre>
              const response = new Response( 'Hello!', {
              ok: true,
              status: 200,
              statusText: 'OK',
              type: 'cors',
              url: '/api'
              });              
          </pre>
          <h3>HTTP verbs</h3>
          <pre>
            The five most commonly used verbs when dealing with resources on the web
            are:
            GET requests to retrieve resources
            POST requests, usually used to create a resource but can actually perform

          <pre>
            const request = new Request('https://example.com/data', {
              method: 'GET',
              mode: 'cors',

              });              
          </pre>
          <pre>
            fetch(request)
            .then( // do something with the response )
            .catch( // handle any errors)
          </pre>
          <h3>Creating Headers instances</h3>
          <pre>
            const headers = new Headers();            
          </pre>
          <pre>
            fetch(request)
            .then( // do something with the response )
            .catch( // handle any errors)

      <h2>Sending data with Ajax</h2>
      <pre>
        const data = JSON.stringify(task);
        const url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos';
        const headers = new Headers({
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'

        {
          method: 'POST',
        header: headers,
        body: data
        }
        )
        fetch(request)
        .then( response => response.json() )
        .then( task => console.log(`Task saved with an id of ${task.id}`) )
        .catch( error => console.log('There was an error:', error))

      <h2>Form data</h2>
      <pre>
        The Fetch API includes the FormData interface, which makes it much easier to
        submit information in forms using Ajax.
        A FormData instance is created using a constructor function:
        const data = new FormData();
