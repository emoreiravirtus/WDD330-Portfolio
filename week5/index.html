    <h1>Week 5 Notes: Testing and Debugging</h1>
    <p>
        Errors and bugs are a fact of life in programming ― they will always be there. A
        ninja programmer will try to do everything to minimize errors occurring, and
        find ways to identify and deal with them quickly.

                            Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic;
it could even be as simple as a typo.

            <h2>The importance of Testing and Debugging</h2>
            <pre>
                JavaScript is a fairly forgiving language when it comes to errors; it didn’t
                implement exceptions at all until ECMAScript version 3. Instead of alerting a
                user to an error in a program, it just failed silently in the background, and this is
                sometimes still the case. It might seem like a good idea at first, but the error
                might give unexpected or incorrect results that nobody spots, or lurk in the
                background for a long time before causing the program to crash spectacularly.
                Failing silently makes errors difficult to spot and longer to track down.
                For this reason, a ninja programmer should ensure that the code they write fails
                loudly in development so any errors can be identified and fixed quickly. In
                production, a ninja programmer should try to make the code fail gracefully
                (although not completely silently ― we still need to know there’s an error), so
                the user experience is not affected, if possible. This is achieved by making sure
                exceptions are caught and dealt with, and code is tested rigorously.
            </pre>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Strict Mode</h3>
                    ECMAScript 5 introduced a strict mode that produces more exceptions and
                    warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features.
                    <pre>
                        Increasing the chance of errors might seem like a bad idea at first, but it’s much
                        better to spot errors early on, rather than have them cause problems later. Writing
                        code in strict mode can also help improve its clarity and speed, since it follows
                        conventions and will throw exceptions if any sloppy code practices are used.
                        Not using strict mode is often referred to as 'sloppy mode' as it’s forgiving of
                        sloppy programming practices. Strict mode encourages a better quality of
                        JavaScript to be written that befits a ninja programmer, so its use is
                        recommended
                    </pre>
                    <p>To use strict mode, add this code to the beggining of a JS file</p>
                    <code>
                        'use strict';
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        You can even use strict mode on a per-function basis by adding the line inside a
                        function. Strict mode will then only be applied to anything inside that function:
                    </p>
                    <h4>In fact, the recommended way to invoke strict mode is to place all your code into
                        a self-invoking function</h4>
                    <code>
                        (function() {
                        'use strict';
                        // All your code would go inside this function
                        }());                            
                    </code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Linting Tools</h3>

                </li>

                    <h3>
                        Feature Detection
                    </h3>
                    <pre>
                        Programming in JavaScript can be something of a moving target as the APIs it
                        uses are in a constant state of flux. And there are new APIs being developed as
                        part of the HTML5 specification all the time (more on these in chapter 14).
                        Browser vendors are constantly adding support for these new features, but they
                        don’t always keep up. What’s more, some browsers will support certain features
                        and others won’t. You can’t always rely on users having the most up-to-date
                        browser, either.
                    </pre>
                    <pre>
                        The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use
                        feature detection. This is done using an if statement to check whether an object
                        or method exists before trying to actually call the method. For example, say we
                        want to use the shiny new holoDeck API (as far as I know, this doesn't actually
                        exist ... yet), we would wrap any method calls inside the following if block:
                    </pre>
                    <code>
                        if (window.holoDeck) {
                            virtualReality.activate();
                        }                            
                    </code>
                    <pre>
                        Modernizr is a library that offers an easy way to implement feature detection and
                        Can I Use? is another useful resource for checking which features are currently
                        supported in different browsers.

                Debugging in the Browser
            </h2>
            <pre>
                Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then
                dealing with them. In many cases, the point at which an error occurs is not
                always where it originated, so you’ll need to run through the program to see
                what’s happening at different stages of its execution. When doing this, it can be
                useful to create what are known as breakpoints, which halt the progress of the
                code and allow us to view the value of different variables at that point in the
                program. There are a number of options for debugging JavaScript code in the
                browser.

            </h2>
            <p>
                So far we’ve seen errors that are thrown automatically by the JavaScript engine
                when an error occurs. It’s also possible to throw your own exceptions using the
                throw statement. This will allow for any problems in your code to be highlighted
                and dealt with, rather than lurk quietly in the background.
            </p>
            <code>
                throw new Error('Something has gone badly wrong!');

            <h2>
                Exception Handling
            </h2>
            <pre>
                When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message. This
                is ideal in development as it allows us to identify and fix errors. In production,
                however, it will appear as if the program has crashed, which does not reflect well
                on a ninja programmer.
            </pre>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>try, catch, and finally</h3>
                    <p>
                        If we suspect a piece of code will result in an exception, we can wrap it in a try
block. This will run the code inside the block as normal, but if an exception
occurs it will pass the error object that is thrown onto a catch block.
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        function imaginarySquareRoot(number) {
                        'use strict';
                        try {
                        return String(squareRoot(number));
                        } catch(error) {
                        return squareRoot(-number)+'i';
                        }
                        }                            
                    </code>
                    <pre>
                        A finally block can be added after a catch block. This will always be executed
                        after the try or catch block, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.
                        It is useful if you want some code to run in both cases. 
                    </pre>
                    <code>
                        finally {
                        return `+ or - ${answer}`;
                        }

            <h2>Tests</h2>
            <pre>
                Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked.
                Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, and any
                errors will be identified early on.
                A test can simply be a function that tests a piece of code runs as it should. For
                example, we could test that the squareRoot() function that we wrote earlier
                returns the correct answer with the following function:
            </pre>
            <code>
                function itSquareRoots4() {
                    return squareRoot(4) === 2;
                }                    
            </code>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>TDD - Test-driven Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual
                        code. Obviously these tests will initially fail, because there is no code to test.
                        The next step is to write some code to make the tests pass. After this, the code is
                        refactored to make it faster, more readable, and remove any repetition. The code
                        is continually tested at each stage to make sure it continues to work. This process
                        should be followed in small piecemeal chunks every time a new feature is
                        implemented, resulting in the following workflow:
                    </p>

                        <li>
                            Write tests (that initially fail)
                        </li>
                        <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
                        <li>Refactor the code</li>
                        <li>Test refactored code</li>
                        <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
